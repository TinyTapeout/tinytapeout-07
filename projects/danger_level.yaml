# This file specifies the danger level overrides for specific projects.
#
# The following danger levels are available:
#
# - safe: The project is safe to run (default for purely digital projects).
# - medium: The project can damage the ASIC under certain conditions.
# - high: The project will damage the ASIC.
# - unknown: The danger level is unknown (default for analog / custom GDS projects).
#
# Example:
# ```yaml
# tt_um_risky_riscv:
#    level: medium
#    reason: 'The project shorts the power rails when the "addi x0, x0, 0xdeadbeef" instruction is executed.'
# ```
tt_um_htfab_fprn:
  level: medium
  reason: 'Should be used with a bring-up script that preloads a safe configuration. Otherwise it can power up in an unknown state and may short some digital inputs (including clk & rst_n).'
