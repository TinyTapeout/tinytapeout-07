## How it works

Implementation of a simple 8-bit SUBNEG CPU. The CPU interfaces to external SRAM memory through address output latch. CPU output can be implemented using a second output latch. The program to be executed has to be written to the SRAM by external means (e.g. a microcontroller) prior to setting CPU enable pin high. 3 inputs are provided for this purpose (CPU enable, External SRAM address latch CLK, External SRAM WEn).

## External hardware

3.3V SRAM memory (e.g. AS6C6264).
Memory address latch (e.g. 74HC574).
CPU output latch (e.g. 74HC574).
Device capable of displaying 8-bit output value.
