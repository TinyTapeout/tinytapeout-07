## How it works

The tiny TPU is a accelerator board for multiplying matricies. This version only supports 2x2 matrix multiplication. However, I will be updating the project to muhc more complex computations.

## How to test

You can run the test file and see how random two 2x2 matricies are multiplied and passed out.

## External hardware

There arent any hardware required for this project. However, you do need a driver to convert matricies and push as an input, then read as a output. I will be providing a simple driver once im done with the RTL design
