  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "This is a very simple, configurable clock. By default it's 20 MHz, but it can be configured to 10/12/14 Mhz."      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "SystemVerilog, TL-Verilog" # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     20_000_000   # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
