## What is it

- This is a tiniest ASIC GPU.  It can render a quad using two triangles with texture mapped.
- The chip comes with two texture ROM images. (My schools' logo)
- The transformation, lighting and rasterization are done in the GPU.
- It support solid shading with one directional light source and affine texture mapping.
- All 3D data (coordinates, transformation, render mode) are sent from the PC each frame via a COM port.
- The output is sent to the VGA monitor using TinyVGA.  The output resolution is 640x480 pixels, 6-bit RGB.
- The clock fequency is 50 Mhz.

## Folders

1. src: ASIC Verilog version
2. Basys3: Verilog version targeted Basys3 FPGA board
3. Verilator_sim: Verilog simulation version using Verilator and SDL
4. test_software: PC app used to sending data to the GPU

## How to use
Plugin a TinyVGA PMOD, connect at the port uio. \
Send UART command to control the GPU via serial console, ui_in[3] - RX

Please go to
https://github.com/pongsagon/tt07-tiniest-gpu/tree/main/test_software to get the testing app. \
ASIC GPU testing app written in C run on Windows. \
To be able to run on different OS, you may need to use different UART library. \
The app will send these data, 60 bytes, each frame @11520 baud rate to the GPU
- 4 vertices world coordinate that form a quad
- 1 normalize normal
- 1 normalize light direction
- 3x4 ModelViewProjection matrix. (third row is not used)
- 1 byte render mode
  - solid shading, texture, alpha masked

The data are in the format of fixed point Q8.8 except for the 1-byte render mode. \
The code has been successfully tested with the Basys3 board, sending data at 60fps.

## Run/Edit the code
1. The code rely on SFML library for the input and windows. https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/start-vc.php. \
   Please install SFML first.
2. Change the COM port number in C code to match with the ASIC/FPGA port (main_serial.cpp, line number 330)
3. short cut keys
   - arrow key: yaw pitch
   - as: zoom
   - df: change model size
   - er: X translation
   - 012: render mode
   - 34: change texture
   - 6789: change triangle 1 color
   - uiop: change triangle 2 color
4. You can also changes the vertices coordinate, quad normal and light direction using code.  I have not write short cut keys for setting them.

## How it work

- Fixed point
   - All of the calculation are done in fixed point.
   - The format of the fixed point is depend on the type of variables to save register space as much as possible. Thus, they are a lot of bit operation in the code to transiton between fixed point formats.
- Modules
   - ia.v (input assembly)
      - manage reading data (60 bytes each frame) from UART and save to the registers 
   - vs.v (vertex stage)
      - transform vertices from world space to screen space
      - compute lighting intensity color for each triangle
      - compute triangles' edge parameters and barycentric coordinates 
   - raster.v
      - rasterization two triangles, interpolate color, texture mapping 
- No framebuffer or linebuffer
   -  Each pixel color has to be computed in 2 clock cycles.
   -  the rasterization is running in parallel with the vertex stage.
   -  Using incremental edge function to do pixel-triangle inside test.
- Computation steps
   1. read data from the PC via UART (in project.v, ia.v)
   2. for each frame (in vs.v)
      - transform vertices to screen space and compute lighting
      - (done during VBlank) compute triangles' edge parameters and barycentric coordinates
      - all of these calculation are done in 82 states and use around 2,000 clock cycles.
   4. for each scanline (in vs.v, raster.v)
      - done in 1 clock cycle
      - increment edge functions parameters of each scanline
      - increment barycentric parameters of each scanline
   5. for each pixel (in raster.v)
      - 1st clock cycle:
         - check pixel inside/outside of which triangles
         - compute interpolated (u,v) of this pixel, get texel color from this (u,v)
      - 2nd clock cycle:
         - color the pixel using texel color or light intensity color
         - actually the texture ROM is monochorme, the color is hardcoded using (u,v) coordinate.
