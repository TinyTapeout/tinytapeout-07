## How it works

# Send Recieve Project Description
*A simple 4-value send/receive chip*

This project realizes a very simple 4-value sender and receiver chip. The mode 
of the chip is determined by input 7: **sender low, receiver high**. Currently,
the protocol only supports 1 sender and 1 receiver.

### Sender Mode
Sender mode is enabled when **Input\[7\]** is set low. In sender mode, the chip 
looks for a rising value on bits 0:4 of the input bus. This can be achieved 
through the use of a 4-button PMOD module, or by toggling the corresponding DIP 
switch on the carrier board.

***Sender Mode Input:***

| \# | Input      | Description               |
| -- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 0  | input\[0\] | bit\[0\] to send          |
| 1  | input\[1\] | bit\[1\] to send          |
| 2  | input\[2\] | bit\[2\] to send          |
| 3  | input\[3\] | bit\[3\] to send          |
| 4  | unused     | N/A                       |
| 5  | unused     | N/A                       |
| 6  | unused     | N/A                       |
| 7  | input\[7\] | Sender/Receiver indicator |

To send data, the sender pulls **Output\[0\]** high and relays the corresponding 
input bit (i) on **Output\[i+1\]** (Note: currently only one bit can be sent at 
a time). The Sender also sets **Output\[7\]** to indicate to the connected chip
that it should operate in receiver mode. 

Finally, The sender keeps **Output\[0\]** high long enough to prevent the 
receiver's debounce filtering from masking the signal before setting it low 
again.

***Sender Mode Output:***

| \# | Output                    | Description                  |
| -- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0  | Transmit                  | Signal receiver to read data |
| 1  | x\_bit\[0\]               | Transmit bit\[0\]            |
| 2  | x\_bit\[1\]               | Transmit bit\[1\]            |
| 3  | x\_bit\[2\]               | Transmit bit\[2\]            |
| 4  | x\_bit\[3\]               | Transmit bit\[3\]            |
| 5  | unused                    | N/A                          |
| 6  | unused                    | N/A                          |
| 7  | Mode\_of\_connected\_chip | Sender/Receiver indicator    |

### Receiver Mode
Receiver mode is enabled when **Input\[7\]** is set high. In receiver mode, the 
chip listens on **Input\[0:5\]**. It waits until the positive edge of
**Input\[0\]** before registering an input. 

***Receiver Mode Input***:

| \# | Input      | Description               |
| -- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| 0  | Read       | Read input bits           |
| 1  | input\[0\] | recv\_ bit\[0\]           |
| 2  | input\[1\] | recv\_ bit\[1\]           |
| 3  | input\[2\] | recv\_ bit\[2\]           |
| 4  | input\[3\] | recv\_ bit\[3\]           |
| 5  | unused     | N/A                       |
| 6  | unused     | N/A                       |
| 7  | input\[7\] | Sender/Receiver indicator |

The chip utilizes the carrier chip's 7 segment display to echo a value 
corresponding to the input data:

| Input\[1:4\] | Output Value | Display Value |
| :----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
| 1000 | 0000_0110 | 1 |
| 0100 | 0101_1011 | 2 |
| 0010 | 0110_0110 | 4 |
| 0001 | 0111_1111 | 8 |

The receiver initially displays zero (on the 7-segment display) until it
receives the read signal from the sender. The receiver then displays the
value received or an E when the value is not 1, 2, 4, and 8. The last
value received, or E is displayed until the receives gets the signal to
read the next value.

## How to test

To connect two chips, configure them as follows:

- Sender
  - Inputs: (Choose One)
    - None (i.e. the chip will read data from the carrier chip's DIP switches)
    - 6-pin, 4-button PMOD keypad plugged into **Input\[0-5\]** (top row)
  - Outputs:
    - Connect all 12 output pins to the inputs on the receiver
- Receiver
  - Inputs
    - Power, ground, and all 8 data pins from the sender must be connected to the receiver's **corresponding** inputs. This requires the use of a specially crafted cross-over cable to ensure the correct connections.
